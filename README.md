# Hi, I'm Arfad 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I mostly work on web stuff, experiment with ideas, and build things whenever inspiration strikes.

I use Go and Typescript (hate to say it) quite a lot and I'm an Arch user (btw). Lately I've been actively developing an app called **RESTUI**, you can check it out here: [RESTUI APP](https://github.com/arfadmuzali/restui) 

Feel free to look around, fork anything, or drop a message if you want to chat or collaborate.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
